# colorGame

This is a game that I created as a training exercise for a web development course that I am currently taking.

I posted it on GitHub so I can save the changes that I make on this project.

The original exercise game had only easy and hard difficulty levels.
I created the medium difficulty after I posted it here, not as part of the exercise.

If I have any new ideas for the game, I will change it here. I am open to suggestions also, so I can improve my
programming skills.

If you are actually reading this, thanks! I am a beginner seeking a career in development, so I appreciate the help!
